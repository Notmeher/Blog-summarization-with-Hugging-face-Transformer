 Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain . Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence in our lives today . Deep learning drives many applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention .  In contrast, unsupervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, and instead, it detects patterns in the data . Reinforcement learning is a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward . For a deeper dive on the nuanced differences between the different technologies, see "AI vs. Machine Learning vs.  Deep Learning: What’s the Difference? "  IBM watsonx is a portfolio of business-ready tools, applications and solutions, designed to reduce the costs and hurdles of AI adoption . Virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant extend the idea of a chatbot by enabling speech recognition functionality .
